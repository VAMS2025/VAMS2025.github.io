Mobility is a fundamental aspect of daily life and is undergoing a profound transformation, driven by societal needs and technological advancements. There is growing demand for broader accessibility, sustainable mobility solutions, and enhanced safety.
Breakthroughs in machine learning, sensing, perception algorithms, computing power, and communication technologies are enabling the development of autonomous systems capable of navigating complex and dynamic environments.
In recent years, there has been a surge in interest in deploying autonomous vehicles across land, sea, and air, showcasing their potential in transporting people and goods and supporting a variety of field applications.
However, highly autonomous systems remain rare. Most existing platforms operate under highly constrained conditions or rely on specialist operators for safety assurance. The deployment of fully autonomous systems has proven more challenging than anticipated—autonomous passenger vehicles being a prime example.
For autonomous mobility to be widely accepted, safe, reliable, and continuous operation must be demonstrated. One of the key challenges is ensuring safety in open or public spaces, particularly when interacting with unpredictable traffic agents. Providing concrete evidence of safe behavior to all stakeholders—including regulators, manufacturers, and the public—remains a critical yet unresolved issue.
